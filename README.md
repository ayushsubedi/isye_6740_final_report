# Detecting the edibility of Mushrooms in the wild
## What is the least number of features to remember to be safe?

Mushroom foraging has garnered a lot of interest as a popular recreational activity for quite some time now. Apart from its recreational indulgence, in several parts of the world, there are people who rely on wild mushroom as a source of food.  However, there is a famous adage in the mushroom foraging community, "Every mushroom is edible â€¦ once". This is because, the consequences of even a minor misjudgement can be lethal. Through generational knowledge transfer and documentation on various species of mushrooms, we have been able to categorize poisonous and non-poisonous mushrooms.

### Questions
1. What is the best model for the detection of the edibility of a mushroom?
2. What is the best model with the least number of features when detecting the edibility of a
mushroom?
3. What is the best model with the least number of features that gives the least false positive
rate when detecting the edibility of a mushroom?
4. Can this model be used reliably in practise?
5. When all features are categorical, does the measure of correlation with the output variable
make sense, and what are some methods to accomplish this?
6. When all features are categorical, does outlier detection make sense, and what are some
effective outlier detection techniques?
7. When all features are categorical, what are some effective dimensionality reduction techniques?
